      <h2>Moving from IC to Management</h2>
      <p>When you’re been promoted from an individual contributor to first-time manager, you’re stepping into a different type of career and becoming a beginner again. To be sure, the creative skills that got you promoted in the first place will help you excel at tackling leadership challenges. But you’ll need to develop additional skills to be an effective leader and let go of habits that don’t serve your new objectives.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>It is common for new managers to stumble for the first year(s) because they hold on to old beliefs about what success looks like and how to best spend their time. At the heart of it all is switching focus from yourself onto others, because you’re no longer measured on your output&mdash;it’s about the output of your organization.</p>

      <h2 id="leadership-profile">Design Leadership Profile</h2>
      <h4>The Design Leadership Profile represents a creative stance on leadership, highlighting the specific areas of value design leaders bring to an organization. It calls out the four pillars of creative leadership—Self, Vision, Team, and Execution.</h4>

      <p>First and foremost, the profile is a tool for self-awareness. It helps you take a snapshot of your skills, energy, and growth areas. The goal is not to get a perfect score; it is to notice how the skills grow with you throughout your career. In other words, what feels like a 5 at your current level of impact may feel like a 3 in your next role. We recommend taking a snapshot every 6 months.</p>

      <ul>
        In addition to self-awareness, you can use this tool to:
        <li>Consider your strengths</li>
        <li>Identify areas of growth</li>
        <li>Consider the areas that generate and deplete your energy</li>
        <li>Ground your role in a common understanding</li>
      </ul>
