        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h4>Dynamic leadership builds on your skills, and allows you to flex to meet the organization’s (leadership orientation) and people’s needs (management modes). By building more awareness and comfort moving between these modes, you will become a more effective manager and leader.</h4>

        <h2>Leadership orientation</h2>
        <p>Leadership orientation is the position you take—or, where you stand—in relationship to your organization/team. Orientations describe ways of behaving that support you in delivering on your role. They are not fixed, and there’s no right or wrong way to orient yourself. It is important to quickly and accurately assess a situation to determine which orientation is most appropriate, and even consider letting others know what stance you’re taking.</p>

        <h5>There are three primary orientations:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Leadership from the front</li>
            <li>Leadership from the back</li>
            <li>Leadership from beside</li>
          </ol>

        <h2 id="modes">Modes of management</h2>
        <p>As creatives transition into leadership, they often rely on directing and problem-solving as a primary interaction model with their teams. However, learning more modes of management allows us to embrace our team’s individual needs more thoughtfully.</p>


        <p>It is not healthy to remain in a single mode all the time. Sometimes it is worthwhile taking time to ask a lot of questions and optimize for growth. In other situations, perhaps when the stakes are high, your mode will shift to being more directive with your team.</p>

        <h4>To determine which mode to be in, ask yourself:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How much time and risk are involved relative to other scenarios?</li>
          <li>Is this opportunity for growth?</li>
          <li>Who am I serving in this mode (myself, my report, the team)?</li>
        </ul>
