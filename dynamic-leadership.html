      <h1>Dynamic leadership</h1>
      <h3>A fixed leadership style is limiting, especially in a hyper-growth organization like Asana that is asking new things of you every day. Dynamic leadership builds on your skills, and allows you to flex to meet the organization’s (leadership orientation) and people’s needs (management modes). By building more awareness and comfort moving between these modes, you will become a more effective manager and leader.</h3>

      <h2>Leadership orientation</h2>
      <p>Leadership orientation is the position you take—or, where you stand—in relationship to your organization/team. Orientations describe ways of behaving that support you in delivering on your role. They are not fixed, and there’s no right or wrong way to orient yourself. It is important to quickly and accurately assess a situation to determine which orientation is most appropriate, and even consider letting others know what stance you’re taking.</p>
